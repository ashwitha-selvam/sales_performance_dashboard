# Project Title

Breast Cancer Prediction system is used to predict breast cancer using Machine Learning model called Logistic Regression.

# Dataset

The dataset used here is dowloaded from Kaggle

# Coding Section

In this part we will see the project code divided to sections as follows:

Section 1 | Data Preprocessing :
In this section we aim to do some operations on the dataset before training the model on it,
processes like :

Load dataset
Check for duplicates and remove them
Check for missing data for each column


Section 2 | Model Creation :
The dataset is ready for training, so we create a Logistic Regression model to do the prediction.
Section 3 | Model Evaluation :
Finally we evaluate the model by getting accuracy, classification report and confusion matrix.
